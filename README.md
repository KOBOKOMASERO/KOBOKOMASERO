## 👋 Hello, I’m **Koboko Masero**

I'm a budding scientific programmer with a passion for climate, code, and collaboration.

🔬 **Background**: I'm a trained **meteorologist** and practicing **weather forecaster**, currently expanding my technical skillset in **Python** and learning **Fortran**. My long-term goal is to transition into **Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP)** and apply these tools to advance forecasting, modeling, and atmospheric science.

🌦️ As an aspiring weather modeler, I’m particularly focused on:
- High-performance computing for environmental simulations.
- Weather and climate data analysis.
- Building tools that empower research and resilience in meteorology.

🤝 I’m eager to:
- Collaborate on open-source Python projects.
- Contribute to scientific computing communities.
- Connect with fellow developers, meteorologists, and climate scientists.

🎧 **Fun fact**: When I’m not coding or studying the skies, I create music — blending creativity in both the arts and the sciences.
