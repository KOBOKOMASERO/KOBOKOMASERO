## 👋 Hello, I’m **Koboko Masero**

I'm a budding scientific programmer with a passion for climate, code, and collaboration.

🔬 **Background**: I'm currently deepening my skills in **Python** and **Fortran**, two powerful tools I aim to use in solving real-world challenges in **Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP)** and **atmospheric science**.

🌦️ As an aspiring weather modeler, I’m particularly focused on:
- High-performance computing for environmental simulations
- Weather and climate data analysis
- Building tools that empower research and resilience in meteorology

🤝 I’m eager to:
- Collaborate on open-source Python projects
- Contribute to scientific computing communities
- Connect with fellow developers, meteorologists, and climate scientists

🎧 **Fun fact**: When I’m not coding or studying the skies, I create music — blending creativity in both the arts and the sciences.
